Overview
Dataset: Contains transaction types, amounts, and account balances, among other details.
Objective: Build a model to detect fraudulent transactions.
Model: Uses a Decision Tree classifier.
Steps
Data Exploration: Load and explore the dataset to understand its structure and content.
Data Visualization: Visualize the distribution of different transaction types.
Correlation Analysis: Calculate and analyze correlations between features and the target variable (isFraud).
Data Preparation: Convert categorical data to numeric and prepare the dataset for training.
Model Training: Train a Decision Tree classifier on the prepared data.
Prediction: Use the trained model to predict whether a transaction is fraudulent.
